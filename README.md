# 📚 Library Management System

## 🎓 Presented By:
**AKSHAD MAKHANA**  
**SANJIVANI UNIVERSITY**  

## 📖 Overview

This is a simple **Library Management System** built using C++ as part of my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) presentation**. It demonstrates efficient book management using **Doubly Linked Lists, Bubble Sort, and Linear Search**. This system allows users to manage a library by adding, deleting, searching, issuing, and returning books efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

✨ **Efficient Book Storage** using **Doubly Linked List**  
🗑️ **Delete Books** by ID  
🔍 **Search Books** using **Linear Search**  
📜 **Display All Available Books**  
📦 **Issue & Return Books** with a **Boolean flag**  
🔢 **Count Total Books** in the library  
✍️ **Show Books** by a specific author  
🔄 **Sort Books** **alphabetically by title using Bubble Sort**  

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 🔧 Prerequisites:

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- Any C++ development environment (VS Code, Dev-C++, CodeBlocks, etc.)

### 🚀 Steps to Run:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd library-management-system
   ```
3. Compile the C++ program:
   ```sh
   g++ library_management_system.cpp -o library
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```sh
   ./library
   ```

## 📜 Usage Guide

After running the program, a **menu-driven interface** will appear with the following options:

```
1. Add Book
2. Delete Book
3. Search Book by Title
4. Display All Books
5. Issue Book
6. Return Book
7. Count Total Books
8. Show Books by Author
9. Sort Books by Title
10. Exit
```

Select an option by entering the corresponding number and follow the prompts.
